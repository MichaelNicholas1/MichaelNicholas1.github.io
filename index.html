          <h5 id="Intro" >Hello, I'm Mike. I'm a software engineer from Rockville Centre, New York. I am a May 2020 graduate from the University at Albany, and currently have my B.A. in Computer Science with a double minor in Informatics and Business.</h5>
          <h5 id ="Intro"> Despite a personal affinity towards java development, I have been a part of numerous works, projects, and relevant extra-curricular activities, including developing the PHP backend and SQL database for a asset portfolio management application, tutoring for my college's informatics department for a beginner's Python course, and even took part in a UI/UX Software Engineering internship abroad in Muenster, Germany. Feel free to look more in-depth at my work below or by navigating my portfolio!</h5>

            <p>TradeX was a combined effort by me and my software engineering class group to compete against other groups in the class for a "fake bid on a contract" that was calling for aspiring software engineers to create a portfolio management application. The application collects user's stock information and plots them using tabular and graphing data, the latter of which utilizes highcharts.</p> 
             <p> My role in the project was to develop our PHP backend, manage our SQL database for user/asset/portfolio information, as well as that of a business liasion in presenting our work to our "customer" (our professor would switch back and forth between guiding mentor and scrutinizing customer), during our three separate formal product demonstrations, as well as the more nuanced, behind the scenes interactions.
              </p><p>Feel free to take a look at the video I created for more details on the application itself!</p>

              <p>In the last semester of my senior year of college, I journeyed to Germany for a Software Engineering Internship focusing on "Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction".</p>
              <p> My role was to update the look and feel of the debugger window used for testing the controllers seen in the picture here. These controllers are an essential part for the building and use (by aspiring engineers) of simple machines, created by Fischertechnik.</p>
              <p> Although COVID-19 cut my internship short, I was able to work within a real, international software engineering team, boasting both my interpersonal and problem-solving skills, and I had the opportunity to attend scrum meetings, creat multiple mockups/designs for the product, and I got to start extensive learning into the languages necessary for the project.</p>
