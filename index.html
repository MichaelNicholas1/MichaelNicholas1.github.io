          <h5 id="Intro" >Hello there! You can call me Mike. I am a technical professional with prior experience in several software engineering environments who now focuses on data analytics, product development and research, and all things data-driven decision-making. I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (with minors in Informatics and Business), Summa Cum Laude in May of 2020 from the University at Albany, and completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in August of 2021.</h5>
          <h5 id ="Intro">My passion has always been expanding towards a wide range of technical fields and projects. Some of my past work, both personal projects and job experience, include development on an asset portfolio management application developed with PHP and MySQL, an international UI/UX Software Engineering internship in Muenster, Germany, a case study exploring the differences between member and casual riders collected by a fictional bike-sharing company called Cyclistic, and a Champion Mastery Comparison tool utilizing characters from the hit MOBA game League of Legends. Feel free to take an extended look into my work below, or connect with me across several platforms!</h5>

              <p>At the start of 2021, I was fortunate enough to team up with Joshua Murphy, Founder and CEO of IdeasFWD. IdeasFWD is a young and small start-up self-described as "more than a communications firm; but a movement to challenge the status quo and give power back to the people." </p>
              <p> Joshua hired me as a Lead Techincal Intern at the beginning of January, quickly extending my role to a Lead Product and Technical Intern. We've been working together along with a small team in developing a mobile-focused project management application. While I am not at liberty to divulge too much information about the project, my responsibilities thusfar have been in product-and-development-centric research and analytics, application prototyping, mockups, and wireframing all through the use of Figma, promoting a psuedo agile weekly sprint structure, overseeing a separate web-based form of our application, and establishing an application pitch deck. </p>
              <p> Despite the prevalence of COVID-19, the project has proven to be a great way to flourish and grow my communication and leadership skills, as I have worked hard towards understanding client requirements and translating them into application features. The experience gained from designing and building this real-world application has proven to be excellent in so many facets of my software and programming principles, and I am excited to be a continued and valued part of the team. </p>

            <h2 class="display-4">Cyclistic Biking</h2>
              <p>As a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I was tasked with completing a self-paced capstone project. This capstone was in the form of a case study involving a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic. The purpose of the study was to delineate between casual and member ridership data and trends to determine actionable insights that could provide the top three potential conversion marketing strategies.</p>
              <p>This project was the culmination of the skills I learned in this certificate, including choosing between developed software skills in Tableau, BigQuery, the Google Workspace (Sheets, Slides, Docs), Excel Spreadsheets, and R/RStudio, as well as best practices and important methodlogies, such as the six phases of data analysis. You can find out more information about the project by either watching the attached video or by exploring the presentation linked below.

            <h2 class="display-4">TradeX</h2>
            <p>TradeX was a combined effort by me and my software engineering class group to compete against other groups in the class for a "fake bid on a contract" that was calling for aspiring software engineers to create a portfolio management application. The application collects user's stock information and plots them using tabular and graphing data, the latter of which utilizes highcharts.</p> 
             <p> My role in the project was to develop our PHP backend, manage our MySQL database for user/asset/portfolio information, as well as that of a business liasion in presenting our work to our "customer" (our professor would switch back and forth between guiding mentor and scrutinizing customer), during our three separate formal product demonstrations, as well as the more nuanced, behind the scenes interactions.

              <p>In the last semester of my senior year of college, I journeyed to Germany for a Software Engineering Internship focusing on "Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction".</p>
              <p> My role was to update the look and feel of the debugger window used for testing the controllers seen in the picture here. These controllers are an essential part for the building and use (by aspiring engineers) of simple machines, created by Fischertechnik.</p>
              <p> Although COVID-19 cut my internship short, I was able to work within a real, international software engineering team, boasting both my interpersonal and problem-solving skills, and I had the opportunity to attend scrum meetings, create multiple mockups/designs for the product, and perform extensive learning into the languages necessary for the project.</p>

              <p>This personal project (which is currently on hold) started in my spare time back in Winter of 2019. I ended up contributing more towards the project starting in December of 2020, where I started to take it more seriously to prepare myself for future roles in software engineering. </p>
              <p>The project is a proof-of-concept application hosted on Heroku that allows for players of the popular MOBA game League of Legends to compare their character data and mastery with other players, to see who is the best at what characters.  It uses <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">Riot Games' developer API</a> to collect player data and champion statistics, stores them into a MySQL relational database, and displays them in a PHP frontend application.</p>
              <p>In it's current state, the program is quite barebones. It displays the character data of a single user at a time, but I really need to kick this project back into gear and start to include new characters and features that have released since I last worked on it! (Please keep in mind that that the API key for this website has to be regenerated manually each day, so please contact me if you would like me to update the key so that you can see the product in action). </p>
